# Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

During a natural disaster, people send a lot of messages asking for help, food or just to inform about what is happening in a certain moment and location.
In this project we are going to analyze a dataset from [Figure Height](https://appen.com/), containing messages sent during a natual disaster.
After a little bit of data exploration, we are going to build a model which aim to classify the message in a category that fit the type of help needed.
The last step will be to build a web app in order to classify a new message inputted by the user.
